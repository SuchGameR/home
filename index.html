                <h3>An aside to the creation of this site</h3>
                <br>
                <p class="center-p">Hi, I'm SGR.<br>Have you ever written commands or source code?<br>I am familiar with code since I was a child.<br>I built this website and published it, and most of you would be "wow"
                    <br><br>But I myself used to, of course, not be able to source code or even write commands.<br>But I go to foreign websites and foreign YouTube. So, what I realized is, "If you do the same thing every day, you will get used to it.
                    <br><br>What about?" Isn't it obvious?" but it is very important.<br>It is the same for studying, and when you practice or learn something, you learn it by repeating it.
                    <br>The same is true for programming languages.
                    <br>It may sound difficult, but there are quite a few people who think programming languages are difficult.<br>It is not that programs are difficult, but that it is difficult to "think about the mechanism of processing" of a program.
                    <br><br>Most of the processing of a program is "processing", "conditional branching", and "repetition"
                    <br><br>Processing allows you to give commands to the computer
                    <br>Conditional branching allows the computer to determine if the conditions match.
                    <br>Repetition allows the computer to determine how many times to repeat the process
                    <br><br>Some programs are difficult in their syntax, but I don't want you to mistake them for something that can never be done!
                    <br>In this day and age, IT is advancing rapidly. Although some convenient things are coming out, I think it is also important to think creatively so that you can "create your own" inconvenient things.
                    <br><br>What I am trying to say here is, "Never give up" and "How can I change things?" I wrote this in my own way here.
                    <br>I hope that my thoughts will reach you even through the Internet.
                    <br>Finally, here's a message, please press the button below.
